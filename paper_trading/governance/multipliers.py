"""Single source of truth for governance multiplier computation.

Consolidates the multiplier chain (regime × narrative × liquidity) that was
previously duplicated across 4+ call sites.

Two entry points:
    - compute_effective_multipliers:  full stack including base sl/tp for engine use
    - compute_governance_multipliers: governance-only multipliers for dashboard/API
