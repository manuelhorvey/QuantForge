"""Background persistence writer — single-threaded drain of WAL + DB queues.

All actors enqueue write commands to a shared queue. A dedicated background
thread drains the queue and serializes writes to the WAL and SQLite store.
This ensures:

- Deterministic ordering of events across all actors
- No lock contention on WAL file handles
- Single SQLite writer avoids serialisation conflicts

Thread safety:
    ``enqueue`` is safe to call from any thread.
    The background thread owns all persistence resources.
