# QuantForge — Research Decisions

This document summarizes the 6-month investigation arc that shaped QuantForge's architecture. It is written for a quant developer joining the project who needs to understand why the system looks the way it does without repeating the experiments that produced the answers.

## 1. What We Tried and Why It Failed

### EURUSD Daily With Macro + Momentum Features

**Hypothesis:** EURUSD's macro sensitivity (rate differentials, risk sentiment, USD strength) is well-captured by the standard macro feature set (rate_diff, dxy_mom, yield curves) combined with price momentum.

**Result:** 8-year walk-forward produced 1.65% CAGR. The macro-only model had the correct short bias in 2022-2024 but at 94% short — a static position, not a trading system. The full model had no edge. We tested 28 FX pairs — zero passed the bootstrap deployment gate.

**Why it failed:** Daily FX returns are dominated by positioning and flow dynamics that OHLCV data alone cannot capture. CFTC positioning data is the missing axis. Price-derived features produce noise, not signal, for the most liquid FX pairs at daily frequency.

**Lesson learned:** Asset-driver fit matters more than feature count. Generic feature sets fail on assets where the causal mechanism is not captured by the available features.

### Rolling 18-Month Training Window

**Hypothesis:** Recent data is most relevant — an 18-month rolling window captures current market dynamics and drops obsolete regimes.

**Result:** Average expectancy -0.000192, PF 0.91, 6/16 test windows positive. The model was structurally biased toward the most recent regime and unable to adapt when conditions changed.

**Why it failed:** 18 months is too short to include a full macro cycle. The 2022 model trained on 2020-2021 bull market data (80% of the window) entered the tightening cycle with a long bias it could not escape.

**Lesson learned:** Training windows must contain at least one full rate cycle (approximately 5 years for US macro). Expanding windows with recency weighting outperform rolling windows.

### Regime Ensemble Complexity as Alpha Source

**Hypothesis:** Feeding regime probabilities (P_trend, P_range, P_volatile) as features into a single XGBoost model would let the model learn regime-conditional patterns directly.

**Result:** PF with regime routing = 1.061; PF without regime = 0.231. The improvement was massive. But SHAP analysis showed regime probability columns were not among the top 10 features. The model was not using regime state for prediction — the benefit was coming from somewhere else.

**Why it failed:** The regime signal's value is architectural (different models for different conditions), not parametric (additional predictor variables). The regime classifier acts as a router, not a feature provider. Separating the models by regime prevents the global model from learning regime-averaged patterns that perform poorly at regime boundaries.

**Lesson learned:** When a feature is important but SHAP says it isn't, the architecture is wrong, not the data. Regime routing happens once, in the ensemble; downstream logic is stateless.

### Yield Slope and Real Yield as Level Features

**Hypothesis:** The 10y-2y yield curve slope and the TIPS-adjusted 10-year real yield capture financial sector conditions and should be strong predictors for XLF.

**Result:** These features remained at persistently bearish levels through 2023-2024 despite XLF rallying 12.7% and 27.7%. The yield curve was inverted and real yields were high — both were correct data points that produced incorrect trading signals. The model was trapped in a short bias by features that were persistently wrong for forward returns.

**Why it failed:** Level-based macro features cannot distinguish between a persistent condition that will continue and one that will normalize. The yield curve was inverted for all of 2023-2024 — a feature that is always at extreme values provides no discriminative power. What mattered was the direction of change (rate expectations), not the absolute level (rate environment).

**Lesson learned:** Delta features capture trading-relevant information (expectations). Level features capture environment context (persistent conditions). Environment features degrade performance when they remain at extreme values.

## 2. What Diagnostic Tools Were Built and What They Revealed

### Regime Audit

Audits each regime classification against forward returns. Revealed that the VOLATILE regime has structural priority (overwrites probabilistic classification) and that the 10-bar smoothing window prevents flipping but introduces a 2-day lag in regime detection. Used to calibrate the volatility gate threshold (vol_zscore > 1.35) and the confidence threshold (0.45) for the NEUTRAL catch-all.

**Key finding:** The regime classifier's value is in participation control (RED/YELLOW/GREEN allocation), not in alpha generation. PF drops to 0.231 without regime routing.

### Bootstrap Validation

Permutation test (10,000 shuffles) on each walk-forward test window. Computes probability that the observed PF occurred by random chance.

**Key finding:** 2022 window PF=0.98, p=0.571 (noise). 2024 window PF=1.34, p=0.047 (signal). Without bootstrap, noise windows hide inside aggregated averages. Bootstrap is now the deployment gate — 4/6 windows must pass p < 0.10.

### PSI (Population Stability Index) Monitoring

Compares feature distributions between training and inference periods. Currently manual; planned for automated drift detection.

**Key finding:** The yield_slope feature had PSI > 0.25 during 2023-2024 (critical drift) because the yield curve inversion was outside the training distribution. This confirmed the ADR-007 decision to remove yield_slope — a feature that has drifted outside its training range cannot produce reliable predictions.

### Driver Analysis (Cross-Asset Scan)

Evaluates 28 FX pairs and 10 equity sectors against a standard feature template to identify which driver clusters produce signal.

**Key finding:** Six driver clusters identified: momentum_crypto (BTC), carry_fx (NZDJPY), oil_carry (CADJPY), usd_macro (USDCAD), real_asset (GC=F), eur_cross (EURAUD). Assets within the same cluster share feature engineering patterns. NZDJPY improved from 0/7 to 5/7 positive windows after switching from generic to cluster-specific features. GC=F was unblocked via fwd60 label architecture (see ADR-016).

### Signal Correlation Analysis

Computes pairwise signal correlations across assets. Used to validate the three-asset portfolio diversification.

**Key finding:** Max pairwise PnL correlation 0.055. Independent driver clusters produce near-zero correlation in trading signals. Simultaneous failure rate 3.6%.

### Residual Analysis

Regresses model predictions against actual returns and analyzes the residual structure.

**Key finding:** For EURUSD, residuals show significant correlation with CFTC net commercial positioning (r²=0.31). This identified the missing data axis that macro-only models cannot capture.

## 3. What the Data Confirmed Works and Why

### Asset-Specific Driver Features

Generic features produce 0/7 positive NZDJPY windows. Asset-specific features (VIX + bilateral yield spread + carry momentum) produce 5/7. The Driver Atlas framework (ADR-010) encodes this: each asset maps to a driver cluster with a specific feature engineering module. The clusters reflect causal mechanisms, not correlations.

**Why it works:** Financial assets respond to different economic drivers. XLF's P&L is affected by the yield curve and lending spreads. NZDJPY is a carry trade vehicle driven by risk appetite and bilateral rate differentials. BTC responds to global liquidity conditions and retail sentiment. A single feature set cannot capture these different causal structures.

### Protected Macro Expert Head

The 32-feature model achieved max confidence 0.54 with 4:1 long bias (ADR-005). The macro-only isolation achieved max confidence 0.70 with correct 0.4:1 short bias. The joint model destroyed the macro signal through feature interference — 20+ price features simply outvoted the 5-8 macro features. The protected macro head (fixed 0.45 weight, applied after regime blend) prevents this.

**Why it works:** Macro features have lower frequency and different noise structure than price features. In a joint model, the high-frequency price signal dominates because it has more variance to explain. Separating the macro head with a protected weight ensures macro context contributes to every decision.

### Near-Zero Correlation Portfolio

Six assets from independent driver clusters (momentum_crypto, real_asset, eur_cross, carry_fx, oil_carry, usd_macro) produce max pairwise signal |r| < 0.40, with most pairs < 0.20. True diversification across 5 distinct macro risk factors.

**Why it works:** True diversification requires independent risk factors, not just different tickers. BTC responds to liquidity conditions, GC=F to real yields and inflation, EURAUD to EUR/AUD rate differentials, NZDJPY to carry trade dynamics, CADJPY to oil and Canada-Japan spreads, USDCAD to USD momentum. The portfolio benefit exists because the assets are economically independent, not just statistically uncorrelated.

### Expanding Window With Recency Weighting

Expanding window outperforms rolling on every metric. Recency weighting (linear 1.0 → 0.5) prevents old data from dominating while keeping regime diversity.

**Why it works:** Macro-conditioned models need to experience multiple rate cycles. A 5-year expanding window includes hiking, cutting, and neutral regimes. The recency weighting ensures the model adapts to the current regime shape without discarding relevant historical context.

## 4. What Remains Blocked and What Data Would Unblock It

### EURUSD — Blocked Pending COT Data

**Blocking issue:** The residual analysis identified CFTC positioning data as the missing axis. Our feature set captures macro environment (rates, yields, USD) but not positioning (who holds what).

**Data needed:** Weekly CFTC Commitment of Traders reports for EURUSD (commercial, non-commercial, and managed money positions). Requires: a) automated parsing of CFTC weekly CSV files, b) daily interpolation of weekly position data, c) feature engineering (net positioning z-scores, positioning extreme indicators, 1W and 4W change in speculative positioning), d) walk-forward validation with the new features.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 weeks for data pipeline + 2-3 weeks for validation.

### GC=F (Gold Futures) — RESOLVED via fwd60 Label Architecture

**Resolution:** GC=F was unblocked by switching from tb20 (triple-barrier) to fwd60 (60-day forward return classification). The fwd60 label captures gold's macro-trend behavior better than the mean-reversion-oriented tb20. Combined with real yield delta, breakeven delta, DXY momentum, and gold momentum features, the model passed 6/6 walk-forward windows with avg Sharpe 1.212 and cumulative +96.3%. See [ADR-016](../docs/adr/ADR-016-gold-validation.md).

**Data used:** FRED series T10YIE (breakeven inflation) is available and included as `breakeven_delta_63`. Longer history and regime diversity turned out to be unnecessary — fwd60's wider label horizon (60 vs 20 bars) provides sufficient signal even in the bull-biased 2016-2024 period.

**Lesson:** Some assets need a different label architecture, not more data. GC=F was not a data problem — it was a labeling problem.

### Interactive Brokers / Alpaca Integration — In Progress

**Blocking issue:** The execution/ module contains only stubs. The paper trading engine runs on yfinance data and simulates fills at close. Moving to real execution requires broker-specific order management, fill simulation, position reconciliation, and error handling.

**Data needed:** Broker API credentials, order management system (order lifecycle: PENDING → SUBMITTED → FILLED/PARTIALLY_FILLED → CANCELLED/REJECTED), portfolio sync (reconcile local state with broker positions), error handling (connection loss, rejected orders, market hours).

**Estimated effort:** See execution roadmap in PAPER_TRADING_RUNBOOK.md.

### Risk-Parity Portfolio Allocation — In Progress

**Blocking issue:** The portfolio/ module has HRP and risk parity implementations marked "in progress." Current allocation uses fixed weights across 6 assets (BTC 20%, GC=F 20%, EURAUD 22%, NZDJPY 15%, CADJPY 13%, USDCAD 10%).

**Data needed:** Validated correlation and volatility models for the six-asset portfolio. The current max |r| < 0.40 may be period-specific and needs ongoing monitoring. Requires: a) rolling correlation estimator, b) volatility forecasting, c) rebalancing schedule, d) backtest against fixed-weight baseline.

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks for implementation + 2 weeks for validation.
