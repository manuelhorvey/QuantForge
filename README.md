---

Cross-sectional multi-asset research and paper trading engine with walk-forward asset selection, per-asset XGBoost models, seven-layer governance, MetaTrader 5 bridge execution, and a React dashboard.

---

# Design Philosophy

> alpha is fragile; infrastructure robustness matters more.

The system prioritizes:

* walk-forward validation,
* deterministic execution,
* train/serve symmetry,
* replayability,
* governance layering,
* per-asset isolation,
* and operational observability

over maximizing in-sample returns.

Every promoted asset must survive expanding-window validation before entering the live paper portfolio. Runtime execution is treated as a systems-engineering problem rather than purely a signal-generation problem.

# MT5 Bridge Integration

QuantForge can route data fetching and order execution through a live MetaTrader 5 terminal (Exness demo) running under Wine.

## Architecture

```
Linux Host                          Wine Prefix
┌─────────────┐                ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Engine      │── TCP :9876 ──▶│ mt5_bridge.py        │
│ mt5_client  │◀───────────────│ (Python 3.12 via      │
│ (Python)    │                │  Wine → MetaTrader5)  │
└─────────────┘                ├──────────────────────┤
                               │ MetaTrader 5 terminal │
                               │ terminal64.exe        │
                               │ (Exness demo account) │
                               └──────────────────────┘
```

## Capabilities

* Real-time price streaming (bid/ask)
* Historical OHLCV and tick data
* Account info and position management
* Market, limit, and stop order placement
* Stop-loss and take-profit modification
* Position closing

## Symbol Mapping

QuantForge tickers (e.g. `GC=F`) are mapped to MT5 symbols (e.g. `XAUUSD`) via `configs/mt5_symbol_map.yaml`.

## Capital Sync

When MT5 is enabled, each engine cycle syncs internal capital bases to the live Exness account equity. Position sizing uses the real account balance.

---

# Model Architecture

Each asset runs an independent XGBoost model with per-asset configuration.

```text
Objective: binary:logistic
Trees:     300
LR:        0.02
Depth:     per-asset (2–5)
```

No shared multi-asset model exists.

---

# Feature Engineering

Built in `features/builder.py` using per-asset contracts from `features/registry.py`.

Each asset has a tailored feature set combining:
- Macro filters (rate_diff, vix, dxy, breakeven, real yield)
- Price momentum (21d, 63d windows)
- Custom features (gc_lead_1, dji_lead_1)

## Archetype Features (inference-only)

Derived from OHLCV for execution conditioning:
- EMA spread, ADX(14), RSI(14), Bollinger z-score

---

# Inference Pipeline

```text
1. Fetch live OHLCV (MT5 or yfinance)
2. Refresh latest price
3. Fetch macro data
4. Build per-asset features (FEATURE_REGISTRY)
5. Validate truncation behavior
6. Validate model hot-swap integrity
7. Run XGBoost inference
8. Classify market structure
9. Apply execution strategy
10. Enqueue async diagnostics
11. Route through 7 governance layers
12. Execute or defer
```

---

# Execution Architecture

```
TradeDecision
      ↓
EntryOptimizer
      ↓
ExecutionPolicyLayer
      ↓
_can_enter()  (single entry authority)
      ↓
PositionManager
      ↓
Attribution Engine
```

Orders route through either:
- **PaperBroker** — simulated fills with slippage and market impact
- **MT5Broker** — live Exness demo via Wine bridge

## Key Invariants

### Single Entry Authority
All entry paths route through `_can_enter()`. No component may bypass centralized admission control.

### Immutable Execution Contract
```
PolicyDecision → FillResult → AttributionRecord
```
Execution artifacts are append-only and replay-safe.

### Train/Serve Symmetry
The same feature builder is used in both training and live inference.

### Replay-Oriented Persistence
Persistent state is stored in SQLite WAL mode with append-oriented semantics.

# Governance Framework

QuantForge uses independently configurable governance layers with worst-wins aggregation.

| Layer                  | Frequency   | Scope     | Effect                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Exposure state machine | Per tick    | Per asset | Exposure scaling          |
| Feature stability      | Per retrain | Per asset | Validity penalty          |
| Meta-labeling          | Per signal  | Per asset | Position scalar           |
| Macro regime overlay   | Weekly      | Global    | Exposure + SL adjustments |
| Liquidity regime       | Per signal  | Per asset | Exposure + halt logic     |
| PSI drift              | Per cycle   | Per asset | Penalty + halt            |
| Portfolio drawdown     | Global      | Portfolio | Global throttling         |

---

# Failure Isolation

Each `AssetEngine` executes independently via parallel orchestration (`EngineOrchestrator` with `ThreadPoolExecutor`). Failures in data ingestion, diagnostics, governance, execution, or model inference cannot halt the global engine.

---

# Dashboard

A React SPA (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS) served on port 5000.

## Features

* 6-layer execution dashboard (FilterBar → ExecutionQualityStrip → Attribution Breakdown → MAE/MFE Scatter → Execution Friction → Trade Table)
* Governance overlays (narrative status, liquidity badges, PSI drift panel, connection status)
* Risk-parity rebalancing visualization
* Historical trade log with attribution decomposition
* Zod-validated API responses

### API Endpoints

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Wine 11+ (for MT5 bridge — skip if using yfinance only)
- `xvfb-run` (for headless MT5 terminal)
- Node.js + Yarn (for dashboard build)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manuelhorvey/QuantForge.git
cd QuantForge

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## MT5 Setup (optional)

Only needed if you want to use the MetaTrader 5 bridge for live demo execution:

```bash
# Install MT5 terminal in Wine prefix
./scripts/setup_mt5_wine.sh

# Configure credentials in .env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set MT5_ACCOUNT, MT5_PASSWORD, MT5_SERVER
```

## Run

```bash
# One-command launcher: builds dashboard, starts MT5 terminal, bridge, and engine
./monitor_all

# Or for yfinance-only mode (no MT5):
# Set data_source: yfinance in configs/paper_trading.yaml
python -m paper_trading.ops.monitor
```

Dashboard: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

# Known Constraints

* Paper trading only (no live capital)
* Yahoo Finance primary data source (with MT5 as optional supplement)
* MT5 bridge requires Wine on Linux
* Some FX crosses may produce incomplete first-cycle bars
* Macro data sourced entirely from Yahoo Finance
* Dashboard requires `yarn build` after asset list changes
* MT5 bridge is single-threaded — concurrent requests are serialized via RLock

---

# Roadmap

* Deterministic full-day replay reconstruction
* Event-sequence validation tooling
* Extended execution quality analytics
* Multi-engine distributed orchestration
* Portfolio-level regime optimization
* Shadow execution comparison tooling
* Async MT5 bridge for concurrent symbol queries
