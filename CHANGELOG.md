# Changelog

All notable changes to Quorrin are documented in this file. Releases are
pinned via git tags; this changelog is regenerable from git history.

The format is broadly [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)-inspired
but adapted to a research + paper-trading release cadence (irregular, dated by
session, not weekly). Updates follow the date-header convention used in
`AGENTS.md`.

## Unreleased

### Documentation
- **Audit & synchronize** (2026-06-30): Comprehensive review of all 64
  documentation files vs. implementation. Resolved 27 mismatches:
  - README.md: phase count 4 → 5 (PRE + 1a/1b/2/3/4); portfolio badge 19 → 21;
    pre-leak-fix baseline block marked superseded.
  - AGENTS.md Key Files table: 6 `risk/*` paths moved to `paper_trading/pek/*`.
  - AGENTS.md feature count taxonomy: "11 core" / "13 base" → "9 base"
    (canonical 9 + 6 trend-exhaustion + 4 cross-asset + COT).
  - De-duplicated "Small MT5 equity ($107 demo)" Known Issues bullet.
  - SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md: `WALRunner` → `ReplayRunner` (2 places); added
    `strategy_metadata` to persistent tables list; de-duplicated `StateStore`.
  - LIVE_CONTRACT.md §6: feature-builder description normalised to canonical
    taxonomy (15 per-asset with OHLCV, 9 without; cross-asset + COT).
  - PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_SPEC_v1.md: phase count 3 → 5; model count 19 → 21.
  - ADR-027 source-code path references updated to `paper_trading/pek/`.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added `docs/SECURITY.md` (auth, MT5 loopback, .env permission check).
- Added `docs/MODES.md` (per-mode override matrix derived from
  `configs/paper_trading.yaml`).
- Added `tools/doc_drift_check.py` (asset-count + key-file + phase-counter
  linters for CI enforcement).

## v2.0.0 — 2026-06-30 (Codebase Remediation Roll-up)

14 months of hardening rolled up (from `refactor/codebase-remediation` branch):
- **MT5 bridge**: loopback enforcement + supervisor with `/health` endpoint +
  systemd unit + 34 contract tests.
- **Observability**: JSON logging, Prometheus metrics registry, ATLAS layered
  change-point detector (CUSUM + Page-Hinkley + KS).
- **Security**: replace bare asserts, `.env` world-readable permission check,
  secrets scanner, import firewall, pre-commit hooks.
- **Testing**: property-based sizing invariants, WAL concurrency stress
  (200 events, 8 threads), circuit-breaker regression suite (33 tests).
- **Schema migration**: SQLite bumped to `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION = "2.0.0"`.

See `AGENTS.md` "Codebase Remediation (2026-06-30+)" for full list.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-06-25 (Live Sharpe Tracker + Monte Carlo V2)
